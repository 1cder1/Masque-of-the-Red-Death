    <h2>Cristopher meets the Investigators</h2>
    
    <p> Ah- Carcosa... where black stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear forever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray the god will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation, terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth- a world which now trembles before the King in Yellow.</p>

    <p> If pressured about how he came to get the King in yellow he says " That he had bought and read for the first time "The King in Yellow" some months ago in london where he had been studying biology."</p>

    <p> And soon I will go there and claim the pallid mask for my own. It is my brith right to be the next King In Yellow. </p>

    <p> He explains how he does not know why they place him in this hospital without being asked about it. I am as sane as you all. he then some what smiles.(sanity check)</p>

    <p>Failed sanity check will result in Investigator Convinsed that cristopher is "The King In Yellow" and begins praising him.</p>
