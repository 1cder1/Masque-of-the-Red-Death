    <p1>History:</p1>
    <p>- Arkham Grace Church was founded in 19 by Reverend Johnathan White on the site of an old mansion in Arkham. The church quickly became a pillar of the community, hosting numerous events and supporting the townspeople. In 1929, a mysterious fire engulfed the church, and Reverend White's body was never found. Pastor William Harris took over leadership shortly after the fire, determined to uphold Reverend White's legacy.</p>

    <h2>William Harris meets the Investigators</h2>
    <p>- asks investigators what they want</p>
    <p>- has a sad solum tone about him.</p>
    
    <p> If asked if he has any insites on how to cure this madness explain how if he was in our shoes Id say these where trouble spirits wanting something from you. but then again what do i know, Im just a old shabby goof.</p>
    <p> If pressured he will explain how the librarian might know more about this than he does. explain how Mrs Cliftion has a older brother (cristopher I think that was his name) was sent to a mental institution some time ago. He used to be so kind but i guess we all have our breaking points...</p>
